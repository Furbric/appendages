Appendages
==========

This is a spiritual successor to [Tails, by Kihira et al.](https://github.com/kihira/Tails), for Fabric 1.15 and hopefully snapshots too. It borrows a lot of code from Tails and like, let's be honest, I didn't do most of the work.

You know the drill by now - it adds 3d models to glue to your player skin. Useful for like, I dunno, sonas and stuff.

(Er, okay, well, it intends to be one, because it's not even close to done yet. Just wanted to give it a shot since I know Kiriha is pretty busy these days.)

The rename is because Curse doesn't like two mods with similar sounding names, and the mod's covered a lot more body parts than just tails for a while now anyways.

### Planned additions

literally everything lol

Also I want to finish up Mirror Stage (a client to client proxy mod), possibly in lieu of/in addition to the "read pixels from your skin" configuration style.

## License

MIT, like the original Tails.
